Learn how to add your own custom domain to Fern Docs by:

1. Adding your domain to `generators.yml`
1. Running the generator
1. Creating DNS records to point at Fern Docs
1. Verifying your DNS setup
1. Setting your domain as active

## 1. Adding your domain to `generators.yml`

First decide what subdomain to use with your documentation. The most common options are https://docs.example.com or https://example.com/docs.

You can run the CLI command `fern add docs` or manually add the docs to your `generators.yml` file.

Here's an example of a `generators.yml` that has staging and production docs.

```
groups:
  staging:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk
        version: 0.7.2
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../../generated/typescript
    docs:
      domain: example-staging.docs.buildwithfern.com
  production-docs:
    docs:
      domain: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
      custom-domains:
        - docs.example.com
    generators: []
```

## 2. Running the generator

In the example above, by running `fern generate --group production-docs`, we'd see:

┌─
│ ⠂ Publish docs
└─

followed by

[api]: Published docs to https://example.docs.buildwithfern.com
┌─
│ ✓ Publish docs
└─

# 3. Creating DNS records to point at Fern Docs

Next, you'll need to get the DNS records by adding Fern Docs to your subscription.
