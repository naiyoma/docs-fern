**Fern is an [open source](https://github.com/fern-api/fern) toolkit for building
REST APIs.** You define your API (either in OpenAPI or in a Fern Definition).

The magic of Fern is our **compiler.** We use your API definition to generate
useful outputs, like:

- **SDKs.** Client libraries speed up internal development and help
  acquire customers who use your API. **Our auto-generated SDKs are idiomatic
  and feel handwritten.**
- **Server-side code generation.** We automatically generate lots of boilerplate on the server
  side, like Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot. We also add
  compile-time validation that all your endpoints are being served correctly.
- A **Postman Collection**, complete with examples of successful and unsuccessful requests.
- An **OpenAPI spec**, which you can feed into the endless list of tools that support OpenAPI.

Fern doesn't just output files (although it can if you're into that sort of thing). Fern can:

- **Publish packages to registries like npm or maven**
- **Publish code to GitHub repos**
- **Integrate with third-party tools, like Postman**
