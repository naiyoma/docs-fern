Have you made edits to your docs but aren't ready to publish them just yet? You can get a preview URL by executing the following command:

```bash
fern generate --docs --preview
```

This will generate a link that allows you to review the changes without affecting your live production documentation.  Please note that at present, preview links do not expire, although the time to live (TTL) may be subject to change in the future.
