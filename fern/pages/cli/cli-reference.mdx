## Essential Commands

[fern generate](/docs/cli/fern-generate): Create SDKs and documentation.
[fern check](/docs/cli/fern-generate): Validate your API definitions and Fern setup.
[fern add](/docs/cli/fern-add): Incorporate a new generator to your Fern setup.

### Local Execution

By default, Fern processes code generation in the cloud. For local execution:
- Use the --local option to run each generator inside a Docker container.
- After completion, Fern automatically deletes the container. To retain it (e.g., for inspecting generator logs), employ the `--keepDocker` option.

### Authentication Required

Fern's CLI requires user authentication for code generation:

- If prompted, proceed with authentication by typing `y` and pressing enter.
- Alternatively, initiate the process using `fern login`. This command will either prompt you to log in or confirm that you're already authenticated.

Once authenticated:

**Permission Verification**: Fern checks your credentials to grant access for specific actions, such as publishing your SDK to dedicated registries (e.g., npm.buildwithfern.com), syncing code to GitHub, or deploying a documentation site.

- **Proactive Support**: Encountered an error? We can promptly intervene and assist with troubleshooting.

- **Enhancing User Experience**: Fern collects usage analytics to improve the product.
