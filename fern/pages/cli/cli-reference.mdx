## Popular commands

[fern generate](/docs/cli/fern-generate): generate SDKs and docs.
[fern check](/docs/cli/fern-generate): validate your API definition(s) and Fern configuration.
[fern add](/docs/cli/fern-add): add a generator to your Fern configuration.

### Running locally

By default, the code generation runs in the cloud. If you want to run it on your local machine, you can use the `--local` option. This will run each generator in a Docker container. 

By default, Fern will delete the container after running. To keep the container around (e.g. to look at the generator's logs), use the `--keepDocker` option.

### Login required

The CLI requires you to login when generating code. You can login when prompted or use the `fern login` command. We require login for a few reasons:

1. **Identify verification**: If you want to publish your SDK to a registry (e.g. npm.buildwithfern.com), mirror code to Github or generate a docs website, Fern needs to make sure that you are authorized to publish to that location.

1. **Support**: If you run into an error, we can proactively reach out and help troubleshoot.
