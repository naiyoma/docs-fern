`fern write-definition` will convert your OpenAPI specification into a Fern Definition. You'll see a new folder called `definition` created.

```
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ generators.yml
└─ openapi/
  └─ openapi.json
└─ definition/ <--- your Fern Definition
  └─ api.yml
  └─ __package__.yml
```

When you have an `openapi` folder and a `definition` folder, Fern defaults to reading your OpenAPI spec. Remove the `openapi` folder if you'd like to use your Fern Definition as an input to Fern's generators.
