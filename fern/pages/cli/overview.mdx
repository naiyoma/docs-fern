The Fern Command Line Interface (Fern CLI) is an open source tool that enables you to interact with the Fern compiler using commands in your command-line shell. Use the Fern CLI to generate code from your API definition.

## Fern compiler

Unlike most compilers, the Fern compiler does not produce a single output. Here
are some examples of what the Fern compiler can output:

- A TypeScript Node.js SDK
- FastAPI server boilerplate
- A Postman Collection
- An OpenAPI Specification

To support the long and growing list of outputs, we've built the Fern Compiler
to be **modular.** The core compiler is responsible for parsing and validating
your API definition and producing the intermediate representation.

The remaining work is handled by **generators.** A Fern generator is a program
that takes in an intermediate representation and outputs... something. Generators can be written in any language.

specify which generators you want the compiler to run using the special file
`generators.yml`. You can view the list of available generators [here](generators).

## Generator Schema 

In this section, we'll detail the different properties you need to include for a
generator.

### Name

Each generator has a unique name, e.g., `fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk`.

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
groups:
  external:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk # <---
```
</CodeBlock>

### Version

You must specify which version of the generator you want to use. This helps
ensure consistent builds.

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
groups:
  external:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk
        version: 0.7.2 # <---
```
</CodeBlock>

### Default Group

You can also specify a `default-group` in `generators.yml`:

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
default-group: internal-sdks
groups:
  internal-sdks: ...
```
</CodeBlock>

Then, you can just run `fern generate` to run the `internal-sdks` generator(s).

### Configuration

Some generators allow for custom configuration, which you can specify using the optional `config` key.

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```diff 
 groups:
   external:
       - name: fernapi/fern-openapi
         version: 0.0.28
         github:
           repository: your-org/openapi
+        config:
+          format: yaml
```
</CodeBlock>

### Authentication Required

Fern's CLI requires user authentication for code generation:

- If prompted, proceed with authentication by typing `y` and pressing enter.
- Alternatively, initiate the process using `fern login`. This command will either prompt you to log in or confirm that you're already authenticated.

Once authenticated:

**Permission Verification**: Fern checks your credentials to grant access for specific actions, such as publishing your SDK to dedicated registries (e.g., npm.buildwithfern.com), syncing code to GitHub, or deploying a documentation site.

- **Proactive Support**: Encountered an error? We can promptly intervene and assist with troubleshooting.

- **Enhancing User Experience**: Fern collects usage analytics to improve the product.
