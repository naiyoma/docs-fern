Every Fern Docs website has a special configuation file called `docs.yml`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
title: Example | Docs
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - page: Authentication
        path: ./auth.mdx
  - api: API Reference
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary

### Title 

The `<title>` tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and is shown within the browser's tab. The content of a page title is important for search engine optimization (SEO). [Read more.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp)

### Navigation

The navigation organizes your documentation in the left-side nav bar. Each section has a title and a list of contents. Contents contain a page name and a file path. The supported file types are `.md` or `.mdx`.

Let's look at a basic navigation configuration. Here we have two sections, the first is called `Introduction` that has a single page `My Page` and the second is API Reference.

<CodeBlock title="Example Navigation Config">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

### API Reference

A key benefit of using Fern Docs is that you get your API Reference with just one line. Add `- api: API Reference` and Fern will take care of the rest! You'll see your endpoints, types, and errors automatically populated from your API definition. 

### Navigation bar links

If you have links that you want to be easily accessible, you can specify a list of links in `navbar-links`. These links will appear as buttons in the top right of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Link type

A link can be `primary` or `secondary`. Primary links are designed to stand out and indicate that they are clickable with an arrow `>`. You can have one primary link.

#### Link text

A link has text which is displayed to the user.

#### Link url

A link has a URL which a user is directed to. By default, URLs open in a new browser tab.

You may want to use a trackable link in your URL. For example, if using [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters), instead of `www.example.com/login`, set the URL to `www.example.com/login?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=navbar`.

### Colors

You may specify a primary accent color using the [Hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp). The primary accent color is used in many places, including:

- to indicate the page a user is on within the navigation
- the background of a primary link button
- to underline hyperlinks
- the next and previous page navigation buttons

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
```
</CodeBlock>

### Logo

You can add your logo that will display in the top left of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Logo path

`path` specifies the image file location. The supported file types are `.png` or `.svg`.

#### Logo height

`height` sets the logo's height in pixels.

#### Logo href

`href` provides a hyperlink for the logo, often used 
to point to the website homepage. When clicked, the user will be redirected to this link.

### Favicon

Specifies the path to a favicon image, which is typically displayed in a 
browser tab or bookmark. Supported file types are `.png` and `.ico`.

## Advanced features

The following configuration options are optional and allow you to further personalize your documentation website.

### Tabs

Within the navigation you can add `tabs`. Tabs are used to group content together. Let's add a new tab so that we can include `Help Center` content in addition to our API Reference. Each tab has a `title` and `icon`. [Browse the icons available](https://fontawesome.com/search) from FontAwesome.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
     contents: 
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

### Versions

If you have multiple versions of your documentation, you can introduce a dropdown version selector by specifying the versions and their availability.

![A dropdown of the available versions](../images/versions.png)

To add a version, specify the `display-name` which be visible to users and `path` which is a file that must be in a folder called `versions`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
versions: 
  - display-name: v1.0
      path: v1-0.yml # has to be in a `versions` folder
  - display-name: v1.1
      path: v1-1.yml
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-0.yml">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-1.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
     contents: 
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdx
```
