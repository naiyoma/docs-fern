`PR Previews` allow you to generate a preview URL for your documentation. This is useful if you want to review your documentation changes before publishing them to your live documentation site.

## Usage 

```bash
fern generate --docs <instance-url> --preview
```

## Example 

The following is a GitHub Action workflow that generates a preview URL for every pull request.

<CodeBlock title = ".github/workflows/preview-docs.yml">
```yaml
name: preview-docs

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  

jobs:
  preview-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3

      - name: Download Fern
        run: npm install -g fern-api

      - name: Generate Preview
        env:
          FERN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FERN_TOKEN }}
        run: fern generate --docs --preview
```
</CodeBlock>

## Link Expiration

Preview links do not expire. However, the time to live (TTL) may be subject to change in the future.
