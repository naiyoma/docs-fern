## Use your custom domain

Learn how to bring your own custom domain to Fern Docs.

Note: Custom domains is a paid feature. Want to get set up? Reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JkkXumPzcG) or [email us](mailto:sales@buildwithfern.com).

Learn how to add your own custom domain to Fern Docs by:

1. Adding your domain to `generators.yml`
1. Running the generator
1. Creating DNS records to point at Fern Docs
1. Verifying your DNS setup
1. Setting your domain as active

## 1. Adding your domain to `docs.yml`

First decide what subdomain to use with your documentation. The most common options are https://docs.example.com or https://example.com/docs.

We'll add the following to `docs.yml` to tell Fern Docs to publish to `example.docs.buildwithfern.com`:

```yaml
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

When ready to publish to a custom domain, add the `custom-domain` key to the instance. Note that this is a paid feature. For example:

```diff 
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
+   custom-domain: docs.example.com
```

## 2. Running the generator

In the example above, by running `fern generate --docs`, we'd see:

┌─
│ ⠂ Publish docs
└─

followed by

[api]: Published docs to https://example.docs.buildwithfern.com
┌─
│ ✓ Publish docs
└─

# 3. Creating DNS records to point at Fern Docs

Next, you'll need to get the DNS records by adding Fern Docs to your subscription. You can do this by reaching out [sales@buildwithfern.com](mailto:sales@buildwithfern.com).
